# OtherDustLootTableRoller
A loot table roller for the RPG Other Dust.
This is a fairly simple application. 
It has the available basic options (No quirks as my game has not been using them) on the loot table.
You simply select a unit, or an enclave loot option and click roll. 
You can copy the output from there.

No guarantee this will continue to be updated but I may work on the minor text formatting bugs at some point. 
Possibly will add quirks and what not in the future.
